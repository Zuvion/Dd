## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application features a **minimalist dark-themed design** in Kraken Exchange style with a clean color scheme: main background #0A0A0A, accent purple #624DE4, card backgrounds #1E1E1E, white text #FFFFFF, muted text #A0A0A0, green #00C853 for gains, red #FF5252 for losses. Buttons use gradient from #624DE4 to #4A3ABF. The **Kraken octopus logo** (SVG) appears in splash screen and header. Trading charts are rendered by **TradingView Lightweight Charts** with OKX data and **timeframe buttons** (1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 4h, 1d). The support chat is a full-screen interface with file upload and keyboard shortcuts. The design emphasizes usability with rounded elements (12px radius), improved typography, and smooth transitions.

### Technical Implementations
The backend is built with FastAPI (Python), using PostgreSQL for production and SQLite for local development. Core data models include User, Transaction, Withdrawal, Trade, and SupportMessage. The frontend uses Vanilla JavaScript integrated with the Telegram WebApp SDK. Internationalization supports Russian and English. Environment variables manage configuration. The system operates as a **FAIR trading platform**, with trade outcomes determined by real price movements from the OKX API, ensuring no manipulation.

### Feature Specifications
- **Wallet Management**: Supports 10 cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, TON, SOL, BNB, XRP, DOGE, LTC, TRX, USDT) with **individual balances for each crypto**. Each currency card shows logo, current price, balance, and USDT equivalent. Cards with balance are highlighted. Real-time prices from OKX API via /api/prices endpoint.
- **Deposits**: USDT deposits are processed via Crypto Pay with a 2.5% fee.
- **Withdrawals**: Users withdraw USDT to bank cards in rubles. The system converts USDT to RUB using the current USD/RUB exchange rate. Funds are automatically transferred to admin's Crypto Bot wallet via Crypto Pay API transfer method before admin processes bank card payment. Minimum withdrawal is 10 USDT, with a 10% fee. Card numbers are not stored; only the last 4 digits are kept for reference. Withdrawals are visible in transaction history.
- **Exchange**: Real-time cryptocurrency exchange using OKX rates, with a 2% embedded fee. Features robust retry logic (3 attempts with exponential backoff), slippage protection (rejects if price moves >2% from quote), and race condition prevention through price revalidation before execution.
- **Trading**: Honest binary options-style trading on 15+ pairs with configurable durations (30s to 30m). Users predict "Купить" (UP) or "Продать" (DOWN). Trade outcomes are determined by **REAL price movements** from the OKX API. A 70% payout applies to winning trades.
- **Referral Program**: Users receive a unique 8-character referral code and link (t.me/BotName?start=CODE). When a referred user makes their first deposit, the referrer receives 5% bonus. The system tracks referral count, earnings, and displays invited friends list. Referral bonus is paid only once per referred user.
- **Support System**: Real-time in-app chat with admin, supporting text and photo messages, with admin notifications in Telegram.
- **Telegram Bot Admin Panel**: Includes user management, balance management, and secure withdrawal management with ephemeral display of sensitive data for admins and automatic user notifications. It also features an admin messaging system with dual delivery channels (in-app or Telegram bot) and interactive button menus for common commands.

### System Design Choices
The system leverages the OKX API for real-time market data. Built with FastAPI and PostgreSQL, it is designed for scalability. Modularity is achieved through clear separation of frontend, backend, and static assets. Security practices include secure data handling via environment variables, access controls, and a strict policy of not storing sensitive PII like full card numbers in the database, instead using SHA-256 hashes and ephemeral display in admin notifications. All fees are transparent.
